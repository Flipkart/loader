<b>Overview<b>
========
loader2.0 is a distributed load generation platform with server side monitoring.<br>
<br><b>High level Feature List</b>
* 1) <b>Centralized Deployment/Hosted Solution :</b> Loader2.0 comes along with support of UI and REST services for all features.<br>
It allows teams/companies to have a centralised deployment of platform instead of every user having to deploy locally and trigger performance runs locally.<br>
Users can create their performance runs on UI, can trigger runs, monitor them and visualize reports in near real time.<br>
* 2) <b>Scaling Load using Distributed Load Generation Capability :<b/> Loader2.0 deployment works as server-agent model. User can define <br>
work load on server UI and also mention how many agents should be used to generate the load. This feature is extremely important when user <br>
need to generate in the order of 10s-100s of 1000s of requests per second, which is not possible if you generate from single machine.
